        <h1>AU Insider</h1>
    <section><p>I developed a centralized mobile application to address the widespread issue of missed opportunities among university students by consolidating all internship, event, and volunteering information in one platform. The problem this application addresses is the common issue students face when they struggle to find relevant information in time. Important notifications often come too late, or students waste valuable time searching through various platforms such as their individual emails, school websites, or outdated engagement boards.</p>

            <p>The University Event Application solves this by allowing students to access all necessary information with a single visit to the app. Additionally, the application integrates internship offers from external companies like Cisco and Huawei, who collaborate with the university, making it easier for students to apply for these opportunities.</p></section>
